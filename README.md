<h1>Our background, mission and vision:</h1>

MakanJB is a non-profit mobile app that was created with the intention of helping both hungry people and hawker/restaurant owners. It was founded by two hungry brothers who spent their childhood in JB but later moved overseas. 

Whenever we returned to JB, we would always look forward to eating the delicious local foods that we ate during our childhood the most - there was just one problem. We didnâ€™t know where to find the best foods and restaurants.

We realised that the lack of a restaurant recommendation and review app meant that many hungry people, like us, would often find ourselves wanting to try a new restaurant, yet not knowing which restaurant or what kind of food we were yearning for.

Our app also aims particularly to help local hawkers and small restaurant business owners, who are often unable to gain attention or recognition from a wider community, thus leaving them, and their delicious food, unknown to most of us. Speaking to some of the abangs that we always visit for Ramly burgers and satays, we saw that this not only deprives us from the opportunity to enjoy and appreciate their food, but could also lead to financial pressures for the owners due to the lack of customers. 

By putting two-and-two together, we strive to help solve these two problems at the same time.

We think that many of our local delights are also often underrated, so our app can also help act as a guide for tourists to discover the best culinary delights in JB and, in essence, eat like a local!
